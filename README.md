## 🚀 Elevating League of Legends with Computer Vision

LoL Vision is a computer vision project that seamlessly integrates with League of Legends, providing detection and tracking of player characters. By leveraging the power of Electron, Node.js, and machine learning techniques. If i could improve it I would say in needs to be faster, locally running model can take inputs quickly but the screenshot capture is slow ~700ms and needs to be fixed.

### 💻 Code Showcase

#### Efficient Screen Capture and Analysis

```javascript
const captureAndSendScreenshot = async (processName, apiKey, projectId, modelVersion) => {
  const startTime = process.hrtime.bigint();

  try {
    const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['window', 'screen'], thumbnailSize: { width: 3440, height: 1440 } });
    const source = sources.find(s => s.name.toLowerCase().includes(processName.toLowerCase()));

    if (!source) {
      console.error(`Unable to find screen source for process: ${processName}`);
      return null;
    }

    const image = source.thumbnail.toPNG();

    // ... (API request code)

    const endTime = process.hrtime.bigint();
    const duration = Number(endTime - startTime) / 1e6;
    console.log(`Screenshot captured and sent in ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);

    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
};
```

This snippet demonstrates the core functionality of LoL Vision, showcasing efficient screen capture, error handling, and performance logging.

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations

To further enhance the speed and efficiency of LoL Vision, I've implemented several key optimizations:

- 🧠 **Caching Mechanism**: Implemented a smart caching system for frequently accessed data, reducing redundant computations.
- 🔄 **Parallel Processing**: Utilized Node.js worker threads to parallelize image processing tasks, significantly reducing overall processing time.
- 💾 **Memory Management**: Implemented advanced memory management techniques to minimize garbage collection pauses and optimize memory usage.


### 🔬 Implementation Deep Dive

#### Screen Capture Mechanism

The screen capture functionality in LoL Vision is a critical component that required careful consideration to balance performance and accuracy. Here's how it was implemented:

- 🖥️ **Electron's desktopCapturer**: Utilized Electron's built-in `desktopCapturer` module to access screen content.
- 🎯 **Process-Specific Capture**: Implemented a smart filtering system to identify and capture only the League of Legends window, minimizing unnecessary processing.
- 🔍 **Adaptive Resolution**: Dynamically adjusts capture resolution based on game window size and available system resources.

Key challenges overcome:
- ⏱️ Minimizing capture latency while maintaining image quality
- 🖥️ Handling multi-monitor setups and varying window positions
- 🌐 Ensuring compatibility across different operating systems

#### Computer Vision Model Integration

Integrating the custom-trained computer vision model presented unique challenges:

- 🐳 **Model Deployment**: Containerized the inference server using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- 🔌 **API Communication**: Implemented a robust communication protocol between the Electron app and the inference server using Axios.
- 🧩 **Result Parsing**: Developed an efficient parser to quickly extract relevant information from the model's output.

Optimization techniques:
- 📦 Implemented request batching to reduce API call overhead
- 🔄 Used WebSocket for real-time communication when applicable
- 🔌 Developed a fallback mechanism for offline operation using a lightweight, on-device model

#### Overlay System

Creating a seamless overlay system required innovative solutions:

- 🔳 **Transparent Window**: Utilized Electron's ability to create transparent, clickthrough windows for non-intrusive overlays.
- 🗺️ **Coordinate Mapping**: Implemented a sophisticated coordinate mapping system to accurately position overlays on the game window.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Rendering**: Developed a custom rendering engine that efficiently updates overlay elements without causing screen tearing or flickering.

Technical challenges addressed:
- 🎯 Achieving pixel-perfect alignment with game elements
- 🚀 Minimizing performance impact on the game
- 🖥️ Handling window resizing and fullscreen transitions gracefully

### 🔮 Future Improvements

1. 👥 **Multi-Character Tracking**: Extend the model to detect and track multiple characters simultaneously.
2. 🧠 **Game State Analysis**: Integrate game state detection to provide context-aware insights.
3. 🤖 **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Develop a pipeline for continuous model improvement using player-submitted data.
4. 💾 **Advanced Caching**: Implement predictive caching to further reduce latency in character detection.
